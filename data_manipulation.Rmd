Choose some columns and not others

select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight)
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth) # group + gd0_weight to gd_of_birth
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, -litter_number) # only get rid of litter_number
```

Renaming columns ...

```{r}
select(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NumBER = litter_number) #select the columns and rename
```

```{r}
rename(litters_df, GROUP = group, LITTer_NumBER = litter_number)
# if dont want to worry about selecting
# remame function keeps everything, but to rename the two mentioned
```

Select helpers

```{r}
select(litters_df, starts_with("gd")) #select any columns with "gd"
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, litter_number, everything()) #move litter_number to the beginning
#and keep everything else
```

```{r}
relocate(litters_df, litter_number)
#relocate litter_number of the beginning
```
